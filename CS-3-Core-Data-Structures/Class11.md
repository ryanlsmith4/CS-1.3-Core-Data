## Class 11: Iterative Sorting Algorithms

### Topics
- Algorithm to check if items in a list are in sorted order
- Counting how many [inversions] there are in a list
- Classic iterative [sorting algorithms]: [bubble sort], [selection sort], [insertion sort]

### Resources
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive sorting visualizations][VisuAlgo sorting] including bubble, selection, and insertion sort
- Play with USF's [interactive sorting animations][USF sorting] including bubble, selection, insertion, and Shell sort
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's articles: [an overview of sorting][BaseCS sorting], [bubble sort][BaseCS bubble sort], [selection sort][BaseCS selection sort], and [insertion sort][BaseCS insertion sort] with beautiful drawings and excellent analysis
- Watch Zutopedia's [insertion sort vs bubble sort robot video]
- Watch Harvard's [bubble sort video], [selection sort video], and [insertion sort video]
- Watch HackerRank's [bubble sort tutorial video] (*spoiler alert:* contains solution code)
- Watch Toptal's [sorting animations] to see how algorithms compare based on input and read the discussion section
- Watch dancers perform [bubble sort with Hungarian folk dance], [selection sort with Gypsy folk dance], and [insertion sort with Romanian folk dance]
- Watch videos to observe patterns: [9 sorting algorithms], [15 sorting algorithms], [23 sorting algorithms]
- Read Interview Cake's [triangular series article] for more background on counting inversions and pairs

### Challenges
- Implement these classic iterative sorting functions using [sorting starter code]:
    - `is_sorted(items)` - return a boolean indicating whether all `items` are in ascending order
    - `bubble_sort(items)` - swap adjacent items that are out of order, repeat until all `items` are sorted
    - `selection_sort(items)` - find minimum item in unsorted `items`, swap it with first unsorted item, repeat until all `items` are sorted
    - `insertion_sort(items)` - take first unsorted item, insert it in sorted order in front of `items`, repeat until all `items` are sorted
- Run `python sorting.py` to test sorting algorithms on a small random sample:
    ```
    $ python sorting.py bubble_sort 10 20
    Initial items: [3, 15, 4, 7, 20, 6, 18, 11, 9, 7]
    Sorting items with bubble_sort(items)
    Sorted items:  [3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20]
    ```
- Annotate functions with complexity analysis of running time (operations) and space (memory usage)
- Write a thorough suite of [sorting unit tests] to ensure your sorting algorithms are robust
    - Write tests in a way that lets you add new sorting functions without needing to write more tests
    - Include a variety of test cases that cover many different input types, orderings, distributions, and edge cases
- Run `pytest sorting_test.py` to run the [sorting unit tests] and fix any failures

### Stretch Challenges
- Extend sorting algorithms with an `order` parameter to specify ascending or descending order
- Extend sorting algorithms with a `key` parameter to specify a function to call on each item when making comparisons (read about Python's [`sorted` function] and how to use [`key` functions] for more information)
- Implement an [insertion sort] variation using [binary search] to find the position to insert each item
- Implement improved iterative sorting algorithms: [cocktail shaker sort], [library sort], or [Shell sort]
- Annotate functions with complexity analysis of running time (operations) and space (memory usage)
